**StreamTweak** is born to solve technical bottlenecks between Host and Client, offering an intelligent control center to manage your remote gaming PC with a single click.

> ⚠️ **Browser Warning:** When downloading the installer, Edge or Chrome may show a security warning. This is a **false positive** caused by the lack of a paid code-signing certificate — common for open-source projects. Click **"Keep"** or **"Keep anyway"** to proceed. The source code is fully available here for inspection.

## 🚀 The ReBrand: From Network Speed Toggle to StreamTweak 🎮
The project originally started as **Network Speed Toggle**, a utility focused on solving a specific issue in the cloud gaming community: Ethernet link speed mismatches (e.g., Host at 2.5 Gbps and Client at 1 Gbps) causing stuttering and UDP packet loss on unmanaged switches.

With **Version 2.0**, the project has evolved into a full streaming companion app.

## ✨ What's New in Version 2.5.1 — The "Silent Power Update"
The biggest quality-of-life upgrade yet: **StreamTweak is now completely UAC-free during normal use.**

Previous versions had to request administrator privileges every time the network speed changed — whether triggered manually, by the tray menu, or automatically by Auto Streaming Mode. This meant a UAC dialog interrupting the experience at the worst possible moments.

**Version 2.5.1 eliminates this entirely** by introducing a lightweight background Windows Service (`StreamTweakService`) that is installed alongside the app. The service runs with `LocalSystem` privileges and listens for commands from the main app via a Named Pipe. When a speed change is needed, the app sends a silent request to the service — no elevation prompt, no interruption.

- **Zero UAC prompts** during Manual Mode, Auto Mode, or tray menu speed changes
- **Clean privilege separation:** the UI process stays unprivileged; only the service touches the adapter
- **Graceful fallback:** if running from source without the installer, the app falls back to the standard UAC prompt automatically
- **Fully managed lifecycle:** the service is created on install and removed cleanly on uninstall

## ✨ What's New in Version 2.5.0
- **Auto Streaming Mode:** StreamTweak monitors Sunshine/Apollo logs and automatically adjusts network speed when Moonlight connects
- **Redesigned Settings UI:** Professional modern layout with Windows 11-style toggle switch
- **Intelligent Alert System:** 8-second awareness delay before network changes, auto-dismissal after 8 seconds
- **Better State Management:** Seamless coordination between Auto Mode and Manual Mode

## 📖 The Technical Story Behind This Project
This project was born out of a specific frustration in the cloud gaming community. When using game streaming software like **[Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt)** with **Sunshine** or **Apollo**, a known issue occurs if the host PC and the client have mismatched Ethernet link speeds.

Due to how UDP packet buffering works on network switches, this mismatch often leads to severe packet loss and "Slow connection to PC" errors. You can read more about this technical bottleneck on the **[Moonlight GitHub Issue #714](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/issues/714)** and in this highly discussed **[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonlightStreaming/comments/1m35zo7/fix_moonlight_streaming_issues_on_25gbps_lan_try/)**.

StreamTweak makes the workaround (throttling the Host PC's Ethernet adapter down to 1.0 Gbps) instantaneous and completely seamless — no interruptions, no prompts.

*Fun fact: This entire application, including the C# code, UI logic, and Inno Setup installer, was developed with the assistance of AI.*

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Settings Dashboard:** Sleek UI to manage physical adapters and speeds.
- **Smart Filtering:** Only shows real LAN adapters (no VPNs, Wi-Fi, or virtual adapters).
- **Driver Bypass:** Automatically detects and bypasses Realtek/Intel driver localization limitations.
- **Auto Streaming Mode:** Intelligently monitors Sunshine/Apollo logs for incoming Moonlight connections and auto-adjusts network speed.
- **Manual Streaming Control:** One-click activation to instantly throttle to 1Gbps with professional UI feedback.
- **Smart Notifications:** Non-intrusive on-screen alerts inform users before network changes occur.
- **Completely UAC-free:** A background Windows Service handles all privileged operations silently — no prompts during normal use.
- **Auto-Start:** Launches at Windows logon via a hidden Scheduled Task.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### UAC-free Speed Changes (v2.5.1+)
StreamTweak installs a lightweight background Windows Service (`StreamTweakService`) that runs as `LocalSystem` and listens on a Named Pipe. Whenever the app needs to change the network adapter speed — whether from Auto Mode, Manual Mode, or the tray menu — it sends a command through the pipe. The service executes the change with its existing elevated privileges. No UAC dialog ever appears.

```
StreamTweak.exe  ──(Named Pipe)──►  StreamTweakService  ──►  Network Adapter
 (unprivileged)                        (LocalSystem)
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### Auto Streaming Mode
1. Enable "Auto Streaming Mode" in the Settings
2. StreamTweak monitors your Sunshine/Apollo streaming server logs in real-time
3. When Moonlight connects from a client:
   - An on-screen alert appears (8-second delay for awareness)
   - Network speed automatically adjusts from current speed (e.g., 2.5Gbps) down to 1Gbps
4. **Important:** Your stream will briefly disconnect during the speed adjustment
   - You have **30 seconds to reconnect** in Moonlight
   - If you reconnect within this window, streaming continues normally
   - The inactivity timer prevents the app from reverting speed prematurely (avoiding reconnection loops)
5. When streaming ends:
   - If no new connection is detected within 30 seconds, original speed is automatically restored
   - If you reconnect within 30 seconds, the speed stays at 1Gbps (timer resets)
6. **Requirements:** Sunshine/Apollo must be installed in default installation folders for log monitoring to work

**Why the 30-second window?** This prevents an infinite loop: when the network speed changes, it causes a temporary disconnect. The 30-second inactivity timer gives you time to reconnect without the app thinking the streaming session has ended.

### Manual Streaming Mode
1. Click "Start Streaming Mode" button anytime
2. On-screen alert informs you of the network adjustment
3. Network throttles to 1Gbps immediately — no UAC prompt
4. Click "Stop Streaming Mode" to restore original speed

## 📝 Installation
1. Go to the **Releases** page of this repository.
