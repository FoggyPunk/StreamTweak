**StreamTweak** is born to solve technical bottlenecks between Host and Client, offering an intelligent control center to manage your remote gaming PC with a single click.

## ✅ Compatibility
StreamTweak works seamlessly with [Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt), [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine), [Apollo](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo), [Vibeshine](https://github.com/Nonary/vibeshine), and [Vibepollo](https://github.com/Nonary/Vibepollo).

> ⚠️ **Note on Installer Warnings:** When downloading the installer, Windows SmartScreen or your browser may show a security warning. This happens because the executable is not signed with a commercial code‑signing certificate — a common situation for open‑source projects. You can safely choose **Keep** / **Keep anyway**. The full source code is available in this repository for inspection.

## 📖 The Technical Story Behind This Project
This project was born out of a specific frustration in the cloud gaming community. When using game streaming software like **[Moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt)** with **Sunshine** or **Apollo**, a known issue occurs if the host PC and the client have mismatched Ethernet link speeds.

Due to how UDP packet buffering works on network switches, this mismatch often leads to severe packet loss and "Slow connection to PC" errors. You can read more about this technical bottleneck on the **[Moonlight GitHub Issue #714](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/issues/714)** and in this highly discussed **[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonlightStreaming/comments/1m35zo7/fix_moonlight_streaming_issues_on_25gbps_lan_try/)**.

StreamTweak makes the workaround (throttling the Host PC's Ethernet adapter down to 1.0 Gbps) instantaneous and completely seamless — no interruptions, no prompts.

*Fun fact: This entire application, including the C# code, UI logic, and Inno Setup installer, was developed with the assistance of AI.*

## 🏗️ Architecture

### UAC-free Speed Changes (v2.5.1+)
StreamTweak installs a lightweight background Windows Service (`StreamTweakService`) that runs as `LocalSystem` and listens on a Named Pipe. Whenever the app needs to change the network adapter speed — whether from Auto Mode, Manual Mode, or the tray menu — it sends a command through the pipe. The service executes the change with its existing elevated privileges. No UAC dialog ever appears.

```
StreamTweak.exe  ──(Named Pipe)──►  StreamTweakService  ──►  Network Adapter
 (unprivileged)                        (LocalSystem)
```

### Log Discovery (v2.5.2+)
StreamTweak automatically locates the streaming server log file at startup and re-checks every 10 seconds to handle late-appearing dynamic logs.

```
1. Registry lookup  →  InstallLocation from HKLM\SOFTWARE or Uninstall keys
2. Program Files scan  →  known names first (Vibepollo, Apollo, Vibeshine, Sunshine),
                          then broad scan of all subfolders
3. For each candidate folder  →  config\logs\sunshine-*.log (dynamic)
                               →  config\sunshine.log (static)
```

### Session Logging (v3.0.0+)
Every speed-change event — whether triggered automatically or manually — is recorded as a `SessionEntry` and persisted to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\StreamTweak\sessions.json`. The Logs tab reads this file and displays the last 10 sessions in real time.

```
SessionEntry {
  Id             →  short unique identifier
  StartTime      →  when the session began
  EndTime        →  when the original speed was restored (null if active or interrupted)
  TriggerMode    →  "Auto" | "Manual"
  OriginalSpeed  →  the speed key that will be restored on session end
  EndReason      →  "User" | "Disconnected" | "Interrupted" (null if still active)
}
```

The same discovery pipeline used for log monitoring (`LogParser.FindStreamingAppInfo`) is surfaced in the Logs tab, so the user can verify at a glance which streaming server StreamTweak has detected and navigate directly to its log folder.

### Auto Dolby Atmos for Headphones (v3.1.0+)
When a streaming session is detected and remains active for 30 continuous seconds, `DolbyAudioMonitor` queries the Windows Spatial Audio API (`SpatialAudioDeviceConfiguration`) on Steam Streaming Speakers and sets Dolby Atmos for Headphones as the active spatial audio format. Detection of [Dolby Access](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0866fs04w8) also uses the same API — if any render device reports `DolbyAtmosForHeadphones` as a supported format, the feature is considered available.

```
Streaming event detected
        │
        ▼
30-second countdown (cancellable on stream stop)
        │
        ▼
SpatialAudioDeviceConfiguration.GetForDeviceId(Steam Streaming Speakers)
        │
        ├─ IsSpatialAudioSupported? ──No──► status: not supported
        ├─ IsSpatialAudioFormatSupported(DolbyAtmos)? ──No──► status: Dolby Access not installed
        └─ SetDefaultSpatialAudioFormatAsync(DolbyAtmos) ──► status: ✓ enabled
```

## 🪄 How It Works

### 🤖 Auto Streaming Mode
1. Enable "Auto Streaming Mode" in the Settings
2. StreamTweak monitors your streaming server logs in real-time (Sunshine, Apollo, Vibeshine, Vibepollo)
3. When Moonlight connects from a client:
   - An on-screen alert appears (4-second delay for awareness)
   - Network speed automatically adjusts from current speed (e.g., 2.5Gbps) down to 1Gbps
4. **Important:** A brief disconnect will occur during the speed adjustment
   - You have **30 seconds to reconnect** in Moonlight
   - If you reconnect within this window, streaming continues normally
   - If no reconnection is detected within 30 seconds, the original speed is automatically restored
   - The inactivity timer prevents the app from reverting speed prematurely (avoiding reconnection loops)
5. When streaming ends, original speed is automatically restored

### 🕹️ Manual Streaming Mode
1. Click "Start Streaming Mode" button anytime
2. On-screen alert informs you of the network adjustment
3. Network throttles to 1Gbps immediately — no UAC prompt
4. Click "Stop Streaming Mode" to restore original speed

### 🎧 Auto Dolby Atmos for Headphones
1. Install [Dolby Access](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0866fs04w8) on the host PC and enable it at least once
2. Enable "Auto Dolby Atmos for Headphones" in the Audio tab (or from the tray menu)
3. The Audio tab will show a green indicator confirming Dolby Atmos for Headphones is detected
4. When a streaming session starts and stays active for **30 seconds**, StreamTweak automatically sets Dolby Atmos for Headphones as the active spatial audio format on Steam Streaming Speakers
5. The Status box in the Audio tab turns **green** to confirm activation
6. When the streaming session ends, the countdown is cancelled — activation only happens once per session
